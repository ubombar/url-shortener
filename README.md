# Project url-shortener
Small typescript project that has minimal gui and designed to shorten urls using redis.

# How to Run?
You may want to run this project with ```npm i && npm i -g typescript nodemon && npm run start``` if you have a local redis instance running. If not you may want to change the ```REDIS``` variable to ```'service.redis'``` then build up the system with ```docker-compose up -d```. If you have any questions feel free to contact me.
